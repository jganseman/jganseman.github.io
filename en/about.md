### Bio

I am a computer scientist with a past as Ph.D. student at the [University of Antwerp](https://visielab.uantwerpen.be/), staying at [Queen Mary University](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) and [Stanford University](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/) in the process, and focusing on digital signal processing, machine learning and audio analysis. Since 2018 I work at [Smals](https://www.smalsresearch.be/) where I study AI-related topics, including Natural Language Processing and Conversational Interfaces, for their possible application in government.

In addition to my work, I am an [excellent pianist](https://speelhethard.be/project/16310), and as co-founder and organizer of the [Belgian Informatics Olympiad](https://www.be-oi.be), I received in 2016 the annual [prize for science communication](http://www.kvab.be/nl/prijzen/jaarprijzen-wetenschapscommunicatie) from the Royal Flemish Academy of Sciences of Belgium.

### Contact

For anything related to my work, contact [Smals](https://www.smals.be/nl/contact). For everything else, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jganseman) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jganseman) usually do the trick.

I sometimes [write](https://www.smalsresearch.be/author/ganseman/) or [speak](https://www.infosecurity.be/seminar-details.aspx?code=P105) about topics related to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Feel free to get in touch if you want to have me contributing to your project. [Members of Smals](https://www.smals.be/nl/content/ledenlijst) can contact their customer representative; for non-profits or free events I usually return the favor; from commercial events or businesses I expect a realistic proposal - consider three times your standard income fee a good starting point ;)
