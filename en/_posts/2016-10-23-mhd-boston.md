In Boston, October 22-24, 2016, I worked together with Helmut Herglotz on a search engine for music by instrumentation. Music instrumentation metadata is barely standardized, even today you'll never get good results anywhere. I mostly worked on getting data in a useful format and Helmut put a frontend in Django together, the resulting [presentation can be seen on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk7cfJv1Hug).
