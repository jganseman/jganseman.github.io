Some mornings I hear loud ticking sounds on the roof of my room, followed by shrieking and other noises. It's the squirrels that start fighting with the birds or something, I'm not sure. The squirrels are a brutal bunch - not afraid of anything it seems. This morning I found one outside my window, scurrying for food in the flowerbeds - I took a picture, the red eye effect makes it look like the squirrel from hell :)

Dexter, the cat, goes hunting after them, which already almost lead to a family disaster with a mother squirrel trying to defend her kids. But our landlady is all the more pleased, she considers the furry animals as the worst pest in her garden.
