One of the classes that I regularly attend is <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a/" target="_blank">Music 250a</a>. The practical/lab part of that class is to make your own electronic instrument, and to get this done <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> is used: a small programmable chip that is easy to connect sensors to, and that can connect to your computer. It's not powerful, but it's really cheap and it's completely free, which makes that there's already a large number of users throughout the world that do the most  <a href="http://www.arduinoshow.com/show/" target="_blank">amazing things</a> with it.

I know about programming but I never having really designed electronics or made electric circuits. After a review of the necessary basic physics, I discovered they are very easy in theory but a lot less easier to keep track of in large circuits. I almost fried some resistors and short-circuited my computer's USB ports, but after a few hours finally managed to program the chip to make some LEDs blinking in my circuit and attach a few buttons and knobs for other things.
