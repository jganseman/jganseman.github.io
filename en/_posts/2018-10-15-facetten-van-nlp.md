In this blogpost for Smals Research I present some of the many [Facets of Natural Language Processing](https://www.smalsresearch.be/facetten-van-natural-language-processing-deel-1/). This first article deals with parsing and automatic translation. (Articles are in Dutch, I will publish an English translation soon.)

*Edit 07/02/2019*: in the meantime a [second article is also published](https://www.smalsresearch.be/facetten-van-natural-language-processing-deel-2/). It deals with classification, entity recognition and the more general problem of (syntactic and semantic) ambiguity.
