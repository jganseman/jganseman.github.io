After 36 multiple choice questions and only 3 mistakes (not that easy having to convert every lbs, foot, mile to kg, m, km) I have a temporary driver license. It's basically just a white sheet of paper with my data on it. The procedure involved lots of paperwork, lots of stamps, an eye test, several declarations and signatures, copies of all my documents, and 28 dollar. Luckily I had an appointment, I only had to queue for 20 minutes instead of 2 hours. The people in the DMV office of Redwood City ("climate best by government test") have undoubtedly not very pleasant jobs, but they were friendly though and I got the temporary license immediately.

Next step: the test behind the wheel. That will probably be for somewhere in november - the DMV waiting lists are long here.
