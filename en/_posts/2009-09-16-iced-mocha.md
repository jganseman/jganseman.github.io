I still need to figure out how dining at the university restaurants and residence halls works, because until now I've been paying way too much for what I eat - even at the local Safeway supermarket a large bread will set you back more than $4. For the same amount of money I had a large iced cafe mocha this afternoon, which was very welcome since the temperature reaches almost 30ÂºC every day. I bought it at CoHo, short for Coffee House, a small well-hidden bar in the Tresidder Union, which is the centre of a lot of student services. They also serve Stella from the tap, and regularly host jazz evenings, the first of which is to take place next weekend - I'm curious :)

Today is the introduction week for new students. Where last week was awfully quiet, now there were loads of nervous-looking new students trying to get around, and the same amount of parents and family accompanying them. The <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com/" target=_blank">Stanford Daily</a> has also restarted publishing and kicks off with a series of articles on the new academic year, the incoming students, and the budgeting problems of the university.
