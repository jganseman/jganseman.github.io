The fast rise of online translation engines (Google/Bing Translate, Deepl, etc.) changes the job content of professional translators. But are those also useful for the simultaneous interpreter? In this [article for the Smals Research blog](https://www.smalsresearch.be/komt-de-ai-tolk-eraan/) I take a closer look at the specific challenges in that field, and the state of the technology today.

This article was subsequently polished and republished in [IT Daily](https://itdaily.be/blogs/data/computers-en-vertalingen-komt-de-ai-tolk-eraan/). (All in Dutch, for an automated translation into English [click here](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&u=https://itdaily.be/blogs/data/computers-en-vertalingen-komt-de-ai-tolk-eraan/)).
