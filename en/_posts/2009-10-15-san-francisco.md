I finally found the time to go to San Francisco for an afternoon. It's a 55km train ride and in the weekend there are no express trains, so the ride takes more than an hour... Nevertheless, the city is very much worth the trouble if you don't mind climbing a few hills up and down. The city is bigger in reality than on the map, and I ended up doing a fair amount of kilometers only walking the coastline starting from 4th street. Discoveries of the day: the coffee at Peet's Coffee And Tea is not worth the money. The souvenir shops at Pier 39 are funny to visit. Also at Pier 39, I took more or less every free brochure at the tourist information center. And the cablecars are typical, but there's enormous queues and they are $5 for a single ride - I climbed the hills instead. The last train home is already at 20.30h on sundays, so I had to hurry to the station in the end...
