On the Classical Music Hackday at the Karajan institute in Salzburg I worked, after having dropped some other ideas, on a frontend (webapp) for my library [musq: an XQuery library for semantic MusicXML querying](https://github.com/jganseman/musq). The app itself only ran locally and I've never put it online, but [YouTube has a video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZns6-SLrLU).
