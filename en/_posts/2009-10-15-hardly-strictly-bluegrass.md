Every year, some eccentric Californian billionaire and music lover closes down Golden Gate park in San Francisco, invites the best of American singer-songwriters and bluegrass and country bands, and organizes a free festival for everyone. 2 days, 7 stages and a crowd that can rival the largest festivals in Belgium, but then without the entrance fees.

Getting there was an adventure on its own. You can take your bike on the train here, it's really easy, but biking in the city sure gets the adrenaline flowing. Even in San Francisco, that is supposed to be 'bycicle friendly', bike paths are almost not existing, forcing you to ride you bike between the cars on the rightmost car lane. Things don't get easier when turning left or right...

Fortunately, there is a non-official bike route called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggle" target="_blank"> The Wiggle </a> that brings you to the Golden Gate park (which is by the way nowhere near the Golden Gate bridge), between the hills. You have to know it's there - lucky we had someone with us who knows the city - or you miss it. Once in the park, we had to find a spot to park our bikes. When there's no bike paths to be found, there are of course also no bike racks, or at least not enough. Because theft is a large problem, everyone want there bike attached to a firm object. Road lighting is not present everywhere, so trees in the park are the next best thing, and people make it a sport to lock their bikes where no-one will try to get them - see the pictures below!

A hotdog and performances by some artist I don't know, Neko Case and Marianne Faithfull later, I've had a first impression of a music festival in San Francisco. Lots of hippies, the "Jesus loves you"-guy, but what surprised me the most: more weed and marihuana than you encounter on an average citytrip to Amsterdam. Apparently in California, the rules are a like at home: illegal to trade, but you can possess it. Strange country...
