This weekend has been mostly a shopping weekend. Saturday morning I plotted a route through Palo Alto to pass by a few yard sales and garage sales in the neighbourhood. The ads were on <a href="http://www.craigslist.com" target="_blank">Craigslist</a>, Google Maps plotted the rest of the tour. The result was meager, I just scored a kitschy coffee mug that says "I love Palo Alto" for just 50 cents. Playing tourist can be fun sometimes.

On the Palo Alto flea market, at Palo Alto high school, I managed to buy a few old surge protectors and a small painted map of San Francisco to hang on the wall of my room. That market was worth the visit, it was rather large and there was quite a lot to see.

Saturday afternoon was filled with the concert that I mentioned earlier, ramen noodles, and the evening with the US Open semifinals and a night out at two bars in Palo Alto with my housemates (who are, by the way, all awesome). If I may recommend <a href="http://www.gordonbiersch.com/" target="_blank">Gordon Biersch</a>, a microbrewery annex small restaurant chain that brews their own range of beers. Their MÃ¤rzen amber beer reminded me a little bit of De Koninck... Great beers I've also already had from <a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com/" target="_blank">Anchor</a>, made in San Francisco and pleasingly spicy of taste.

Sunday our landlady Ming took us all by car to the farmer's market in Mountain View. The market itself was rather pricy but the food there was of good quality and locally grown. The <a href="http://www.99ranch.com/" target="_blank">Asian supermarket</a> that we went to later later was a real discovery - I brought home a young coconut, some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujube" target="_blank">jujubes</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitaya" target="_blank">dragon fruit</a>, something I had never seen. I left the strange and funny looking vegetables aside for the moment, that's for a later time to try. I got some Japanese tea and a collection of ramen to complete the trip, and had a few dumplings at the Chinese snackbar next to the supermarket.

The cheapest fruit, vegetables and bread we found however at a smaller shop called the <a href="http://www.milkpail.com/" target="_blank"> Milk Pail</a>. Though I had collected already a fair amount of food, I could not leave the cheap pomegranates like that and brought a few.

Together with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_pyrifolia" target="_blank"> Asian pears </a>, mandarins, lemons, and several other kind of citrus fruits that grow in our garden of which I still don't know what they actually are, this will most certainly make an interesting fruit salad.
