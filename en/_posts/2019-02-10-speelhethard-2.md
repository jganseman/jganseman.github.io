Flemish TV channel *Canvas* organized a new edition of their competition for amateur musicians *Speel het hard* in late 2018. There was less time to prepare a piece now, but I took the opportunity to tackle Rachmaninoffs 1st concerto. Combined with my new job at Smals leading to less practicing opportunities, I wasn't really ready on time for the finalist selection early 2019. Still, it's been a great opportunity to keep on playing. Here too, [the project page](https://speelhethard.be/project/16310/) which includes my practice videos is still online.
