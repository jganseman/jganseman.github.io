For the hackday in London in 2013 I used several APIs and Python libraries to chop up a music fragment in pieces, extract the melody, and change its pitch according to a predefined scheme. The resulting [MidiModulator is published on Github](https://github.com/jganseman/MidiModulator), where I've also put a few links to the first (rather funny!) [results](https://soundcloud.com/jganseman/lady-gaga-paparazzi).
