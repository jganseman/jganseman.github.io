On one of the stormy days last week, I made a tour of San Francisco by car. After driving to Twin Peaks and the Great Highway, I finally had the chance to cross the Golden Gate - it is really impressive, even in clouded weather (and costs you $6). But the view is worth it, and you need to have done it at least once if you live here.
