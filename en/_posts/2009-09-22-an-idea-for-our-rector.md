Free cookies, brownies, fruit baskets and tons of lemonade: the president of Stanford University hosts several receptions for new incoming students at his private residence. I visited the one for graduate (Master's and Ph.D. level) students, and met a few fellow Belgians and another guy named Joachim, from Paris. Most of the people were in some kind of electrical engineering or computer science study, the fields that Stanford is famous for. Anyway, perhaps a nice idea for rectors of universities in Belgium? Regarding setting, it will be difficult though to do better than the garden of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Henry_and_Herbert_Hoover_House" target="_blank">Hoover House</a>.
