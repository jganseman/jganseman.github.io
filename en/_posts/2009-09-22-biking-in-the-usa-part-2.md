In general, bike paths are very rare in the US, and bikes are equally rare. Luckily, the situation in California, around Palo Alto in particular, is better: roughly 20% of all roads is equipped with a separate bike path. Apparently, that's already enough to be nominated 'bicycle friendly community'. Compared to the average Belgian city, it is however pitiful. Most bikepaths are actually the gutter next to which a white line has been drawn, and more often than not they are concurrently used as parking spots for cars.

Cars do the strangest things when they encounter a bike - no driver here has ever learnt how to share the road with anything else than other cars or trucks. Drivers will look out for other cars and pedestrians, but will never look out for bikes when opening car doors, parking, turning,... which forces cyclists to drive in an extremely defensive way.

If there is no bike path, a bike is considered a vehicle, and even when there is a bike path, bikes must act like cars and sometimes ride in between all the cars. Especially choosing lanes if you want to change direction is a difficult undertaking: you cannot keep to the right side of the road if you want to go left, because cars are allowed to turn right through a red sign. You're expected as cyclist to behave as car and choose the right lane for turning, so the only legal solution is: leave the bike lane, and try to get on the car lane that is used for traffic straight through or to the left. This can get tricky...

It's no wonder that every cyclist here wears a helmet when driving a bike, because collisions with cars are very common. But also with other cyclists: many of the cyclists on campus have never been on a bicycle before and I've seen people doing the craziest things on bikes already, which does not really contribute to road safety in general.

Another rule that is significantly different: if there is a normal road intersection with 4 roads, the general rule is that the car that arrives first has the right of way (not the one coming from the right side, unless they arrive at the same time). To make that a little safer, a lot of intersections have stop signs on all roads. Which means that, whatever direction a car comes from, it has to come to a full stop before leaving. Things get very unclear when even 2 cars arrive at the same time at an intersection, because instead one direction having generally the right of way and the other having generally to yield, now both cars stop and then have to figure out which one can leave first. If then at the same time other traffic arrives or there are more cars wanting to cross the intersection, it gets even more confusing. There are many intersections here, and at everyone of them you'll see cars stopped, figuring out who is going over the intersection first.

Concerning road and traffic planning, they could learn a significant deal from Belgium. But to end with a positive note: in parks and nature reserves, they are often jogging tracks or pedestrian paths which can also be used by bikes, and with this scenery and climate it's definitely worth jumping on a bike:
