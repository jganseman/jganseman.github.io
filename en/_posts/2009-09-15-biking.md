<a href="http://www.craigslist.com" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> came to my aid once more when trying to find a bike - I'm now the proud owner of a secondhand <a href="http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/mountain_hardtail/820/820/" target="_blank">Trek 820</a> mountainbike, for a very fair price. I went to pick it up in the Mission district of San Francisco yesterday evening.

I have been puzzled last week why so many bikes were mountainbikes or racing bikes, and normal Dutch-type bikes were impossible to find. Having to climb a few of these streets on foot and later by bike, I realized that a mountainbike is an absolute necessity if you don't want to fall over. The view on top of the hill is worth the climb though. Going downhill afterwards is a lot of fun!

Now I've still not had the chance to go into the center of San Francisco... That's for later.
