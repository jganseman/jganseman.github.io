I tried to subscribe to <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/stanford/" target="_blank">Zipcar</a> today - a car sharing system that allows you to rent a car for $8 an hour whenever you need it, gas included. It is similar to what <a href="http://www.cambio.be" target="_blank">Cambio</a> does in Belgium, only a little fancier: most cars that can be rent are Toyota Prius or similar. Nevertheless, if it's for things like getting to the supermarket once every 2 weeks or moving heavy loads, it's still way cheaper than renting a car for the whole period of my stay.

But Zipcar needs one last thing from if I subscribe with a Belgian driver license (while I'm waiting for a Californian one): a copy of my criminal record. On the website of the <a href="http://www.diplomatie.be/losangeles/" target="_blank">Belgian Embassy in LA</a> they could inform me that I needed to send an official request to the ministry of Justice in Belgium - by normal mail or by fax (internet seems not to be invented yet over there).

Luckily they still have a working fax machine here. And after figuring out how to dial international fax numbers, I tried - failed. Tried again - failed. Tried again - "Allo?".

I'm really sorry for the woman that I apparently phoned out of bed at midnight. It's not always easy typing 20 digits (fax number and access codes) all correctly on ancient machinery that gets stuck half of the time...
