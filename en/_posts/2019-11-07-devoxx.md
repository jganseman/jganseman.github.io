With some regularity I speak for a general audience about my study topics at [Smals Research](https://www.smalsresearch.be/). Lately I'm speaking mostly about the risks that come with AI-projects, and that deserve some more attention amidst all the hyping. AI is not a magic wand with that makes everything work from the first get-go: it's a complicated set of technologies, and there are many points of attention to consider in order to bring an AI project to a good end. In these presentations I therefore highlight what can go wrong while developing an AI system (training data, confounding variables, objective function), at deployment (attacks against AI systems), the impact on us as citizens (bias, fairness, transparency) and on society as a whole (policy issues, ethics etc.).

This gave rise to a series of presentations given at
- the [Heliview Data Driven Business Summit](https://datadriven.heliview.be/programme-2019/)
- the [notary congress of FedNot](https://nca2019.be/program)
- [Devoxx](https://devoxx.be/talk/?id=122201) :
