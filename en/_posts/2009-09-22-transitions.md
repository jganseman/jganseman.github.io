Another nice thing about the climate, by the way: outdoor concerts are possible and frequent. Last thursday there was one organized by my lab, called "Transitions". Some music by the "big names" in electroacoustic music was being performed (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chowning" target="_blank">John Chowning</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mathews" target="_blank">Max Mathews</a>, ...), and the fun part was that these people were actually present in person. An 8-channel surround sound system with another 4 subwoofers were installed around the courtyard of the lab. The audience was in the middle, picknicking on the grass. Picture underneath, taken in the dark unfortunately, but it gives an idea: the computer program that was used to perform "Skeletons in the closet" by Mark Applebaum was projected on a big screen.
