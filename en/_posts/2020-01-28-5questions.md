In my first 2020 [article for the Smals Research blog](https://www.smalsresearch.be/5-vragen-om-te-stellen-voor-de-start-van-een-ai-project/) (in Dutch) I describe 5 general questions that we ask ourselves before diving head first into a new AI project. The article links also to a bunch of external resources where more AI management wisdom can be found. For an English translation, you may try running it through [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=nl&tl=en&u=https://www.smalsresearch.be/5-vragen-om-te-stellen-voor-de-start-van-een-ai-project/), without any guarantees as to its accuracy of course.
