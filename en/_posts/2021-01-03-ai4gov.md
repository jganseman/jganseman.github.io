The [Federal Public Service Policy and Support (BOSA)](https://bosa.belgium.be/en/about-fps-policy-and-support) and [AI4Belgium](https://www.ai4belgium.be/nl/) are organizing a hackathon on the theme *AI4Gov*. Anyone who is interested in harnessing the power of AI for more efficient and/or user-friendly government processes, is welcome to participate! The hackathon itself is currently scheduled for March 2021.

I'm happy to be part of the steering committee for this event. While my background allows me to do in-depth technical analyses of the projects and solutions, I'll certainly pay special attention to fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics and privacy. By the way, I find the resources that are available on the Flemish [Knowledge Center for Data and Society](https://data-en-maatschappij.ai/) to be of great value in helping with these kind of assessments.
