November has started, but temperatures during the day still reach 18ºC. One of the Stanford traditions that I had not done yet was "walking the dish". The hills behind Stanford are university property and contain amongst others antennas for radio broadcasting - KZSU is Stanford's student radio. A lot of people use it to take a walk or exercise - I encountered hundreds of people while going for a walk lately.

The most impressive is the radio telescope, "The Dish", that is apparently still in use. From the office I have a nice view on the hills and the dish, and every once in a while its position changes. The walk itself is about an hour and gives a nice view over Stanford and Silicon Valley, with the bay and the hills on the other side in the background.
