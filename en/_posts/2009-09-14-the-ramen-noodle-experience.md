When I went to the post office 2 days ago, I got approached by an undergrad from the Stanford Design Institute, working on a research project called "redesigning the Ramen Noodle Experience". Noodles are the favourite kind of fastfood here, it can be bought extremely cheap and relatively tasty in countless little restaurants (comparable to kebab back home in Antwerp) or just as the cheapest kind of instant food at supermarkets. Amused by the title, I sat down and got questioned for about 15 minutes about how much ramen I eat, whether I would like to change anything about it, whether I had ecological, economical, health-, etc. concerns about it... I do regularly eat instant noodles but the stuff you buy in Europe does not even come to the knees of what you can buy here, so I don't know if my answers were any useful to them. Anyway, I look forward to the results of this research project.

Incidentally, just a day later I was invited to a CCRMA long-distance concert, with people playing synchronized together in Italy, California and Montana. After that I went eating with 2 people at an excellent and cheap <a href="http://myfreshtaste.com/" target="_blank"> ramen restaurant on El Camino Real </a>. Talking to them about what had happened to me the day before, they suggested that the Ramen Experience could be improved upon in several ways: having ramen every meal, having it for free and having it served by beautiful women. I could not agree more :)
