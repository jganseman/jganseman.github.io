I was given a tour of the Knoll building yesterday - it will be my office for the months to come. There is not really office space in there - students come in and out, sit wherever they want, can attend any class, etc. Basically you just do whatever you want, sit wherever you want, and can use whatever you need as long as for the expensive stuff, you make reservations first.

The CCRMA has about 4 recording studios, an almost anechoic chamber, a concert hall with surround sound and a nice Yamaha disklavier piano, an electronics lab with enough soldering irons and copper wire for a large class, a classroom with the necessary computers, most of them equipped with firewire audio interfaces to connect whatever sensor, microphone or instrument to it, and, very important: a lounge on the top floor that looks out over the hills on one side, and the campus on the other side - the Knoll is probably the highest located building on campus.
