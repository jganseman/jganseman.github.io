Every term there are several concerts going on at CCRMA, and in most of these people from the lab play themselves and show off their skills on computer, synthesizer, knobs, sliders and DJ turntables. The fall term concert was dubbed <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/events/ccrma-fall-concert-2009-cagian-musiccircus" target="_blank"> "A Cagian MusicCircus" </a>. 7 different stages were set up through the building, and visitors could freely roam between them. Snacks and drinks were provided at every corner. There were some very very modern and complex installations, and especially the DJs extended the party to the late hours. Because parties here end way too soon, an afterparty followed of course at someone's apartment.
