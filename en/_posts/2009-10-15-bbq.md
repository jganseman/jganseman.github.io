I'm starting to get good at this "finding places where there's free food" thing, but sometimes it takes no effort at all. The Music department hosted its annual barbecue two weeks ago, right in the garden of our building. The weather was nice, the food was free, the beer was free too and, though tapped from plastic kegs without decent pressure system, not even that bad.

The <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/belgica/" target="_blank">Belgian students of Stanford</a> organized their first gathering last friday in the form of a barbecue too. There are about 25 Belgians here, and the first plans for activities together are to have 2-weekly lunches or dinners, and now and then meet with the Belgians in Berkeley.

The day after, me and my housemates organized our own barbecue in our garden at home last week. The weather already changed and it was too cold for swimming, but the food was great again. Nachos can be dangerous though - they know how to make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habanero_chili" target="_blank">really mean</a> salsa dip here.

Actually I'm not a big fan of Mexican food. I'll try find myself an event with free Indian or Asian next time :)
