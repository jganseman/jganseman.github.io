From 2014 to 2016 I set up the [online library of the Brussels Royal Conservatory](https://catalog.b-bc.org/). This included the entire project from analysis to delivery, setting up and customizing a brand new OPAC, a serious effort to increase data quality to an acceptable level, data migration, statistics and monitoring, etc. The 500-page end report of the entire project is available [here](http://visiepc16.cde.ua.ac.be/varia/Migratie-rapport.pdf).
