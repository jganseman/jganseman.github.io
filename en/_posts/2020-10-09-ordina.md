In Covid-times, naturally all seminars and presentations are converted into webinars - also this one, an updated version of my Pitfalls of AI talk that I've given several times now. I update it every time with the latest and greatest in AI failures, it never ceases to amuse!

This webinar was given on invitation by [Ordina](https://www.ordina.be/) for their [JOIN Ordina JWorks event](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/join/). The presentation, in English, was recorded and put on YouTube - enjoy!
