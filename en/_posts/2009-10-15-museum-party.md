The <a href="http://museum.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"> Cantor Arts Center </a> is Stanford's own museum. It opened to the public and the new students with its "Party On The Edge" last week: entrance was free, snacks were provided, and throughout the museum several stages were set up with music, art and poetry performances by students from the Art department. The fire alarm that went off at some point had everyone going outside for half an hour, but for the rest of the evening (it closed at midnight already), the atmosphere was quite unique. Never saw so many students in a museum before out of their free will, though I guess most of them came for the free snacks or for seeing their friends play.

The museum is not that big, but the collection on display is impressive, for a university. A few Picassos and Manets amongst others, but also Stanford has the second largest collection of Rodin statues in the world, next to the Mus√©e Rodin in Paris. A performance next to his most famous statue was unfortunately not very intellectual: sugary love ballads by two rather out-of-tune singing students.
