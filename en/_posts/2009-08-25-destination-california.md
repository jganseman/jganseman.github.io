I'll be spending a few months as 'visiting researcher' at Stanford University (official website <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"> here</a>, Wikipedia page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University" target="_blank"> here</a> ). Visiting Research roughly means that I will not go for a degree or diploma over there, but I will stay enrolled at Antwerp and just do a part of my research at Stanford - as an asset, it saves me a few tenthousand dollars in tuition fees.

With the <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"> CCRMA (Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics) </a>, they have one of the world's most famous interdisciplinary labs about music technology. Musicians, composers, scientists and engineers meet there to work on new technologies, software and ideas that change the way people handle music.

Some amazing software comes out of this lab (take a look at <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/" target="_blank"> ChucK </a>) and some major <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pubs.html" target="_blank"> standard texts </a> on digital audio were written there. But also after hours, there's room for getting out of the lab and enjoying music technology in practice: the <a href="http://slork.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"> Stanford Laptop Orchestra </a> is unique.
