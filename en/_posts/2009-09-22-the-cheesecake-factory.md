I know the <a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com" target="_blank">Cheesecake Factory</a> mainly through <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/" target="_blank">The Big Bang Theory</a> comedy series. The chain really exists though and is known for its restaurants decorated like small palaces and giant-sized portions of anything you order. The menu is enormous and no normal person can finish all that they serve (by that I mean: order a normal salad, you get a bowl the size of which is normally used to prepare salads for 6 people in).

On University Avenue in Palo Alto I recently went to get a slice of their famed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesecake" target="_blank">cheesecake</a>, out of curiosity. Cheesecake is an amazingly heavy dessert, the slice I got was not that big but I did not eat for the rest of the day. Calorie-count for one slice: about 1100 (which is almost half of what you need each day). And that was the classic cheesecake, they also have them with chocolate, caramel, fudge, even Snickers inside...
