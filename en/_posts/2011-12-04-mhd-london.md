Hackdays don't always lead to a working result. In London on 3-4 december 2010 I tried my hands at polyphonic audio transcription, by chaining different software libraries that each solved part of the problem. Unfortunately, each also had a significant error margin, cumulatively leading to no sensible output at the end. A list of projects of that weekend [can still be found online](https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2011/12/04/62-new-music-hacks-from-music-hack-day-london/), though detail pages have disappeared. If I rediscover something in my archives I may expand on this post later.
