At Queen Mary University's Center for Digital Music, colleague Joachim Fritsch undertook a detailed comparison of Hennequin's source separation method with my own, and proposed a hybrid version with better results. His excellent work, including a manually and carefully constructed evaluation database of multitrack audio recordings, can be found in [C4DM's digital repository](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/rdr/handle/123456789/20).
