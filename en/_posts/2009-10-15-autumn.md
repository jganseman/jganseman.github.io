Yesterday, autumn started officially with the first storm of the year. As Belgian, I'm used to a little rain and I thought I'd bike through, but that was a mistake. I arrived at the lab, soaked to the skin. The rain had washed the fine, loose, dry sand on the ground onto the roads, covering them with mud. Strong winds made branches fall off trees, onto the bike lanes and the roads - one fellow around the corner of where I live was very unfortunate, and found his shining car crushed underneath half a tree. At the end of the day, a hot shower was more than welcome.

Today, the sun is shining again and the temperatures are back up, making the air warm and humid. I guess, if the climate is tropical, the storms are tropical too.
