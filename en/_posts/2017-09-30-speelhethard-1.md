In 2017, Flemish TV channel *Canvas* organized a competition for amateur musicians: *Speel het hard* . The mission was to practice a challenging piece for your instrument, getting it to concert hall ready perfection within a timespan of roughly 6 months. A series of videoblogs had to be made to document the process. I took the opportunity to take up piano practice a bit more, and give jazz a try with Kapustin's 2nd sonata. While I didn't make it to the final selection, it was great to get my technical abilities back up to the level I had 10 years earlier. [The project page](https://speelhethard.be/project/7024), including my practice videos, is still online.
